### AIRBNB_CLONE PROJECT ###

This is the reviews component of my team's project mocking an airbnb page for a listing.

HOW TO RUN THIS PROJECT:
- download
- npm install
- open two terminals and navigate to the root directory of the project in each
- In each terminal run:
	'npm run start'
	'npm run react-dev'
- this will start the local server on port 3003 and build the webpack bundle.js file
- navigate to http://localhost:3003 to see the results!
